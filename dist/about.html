            <p class="p-about">Welcome to our mobile app, a dedicated platform designed to bridge the gap between <br>
                parents and sports schools. We are a team of passionate students committed to making <br>
                 the lives of parents easier and the management of sports schools more efficient.<br>
                 
                 <br>
                Our app offers a range of features tailored to meet the needs of parents with children <br>
                attending sports schools. One of the key features is the ability to track your child’s attendance<br>
                in real-time, ensuring you’re always updated. Additionally, our app allows you to view the<br>
                 class schedule, helping you plan ahead and keep track of upcoming classes and any changes.<br>
                 <br>
                We also understand the importance of knowing who is responsible for your child’s training. <br>
                Therefore, our app provides detailed information about each trainer, including their qualifications <br>
                and their approach to training. Furthermore, our app keeps you in the loop with all the latest <br>
                news and announcements from the sports school, ensuring you’re always the first to know <br>
                about any upcoming events or changes.<br>
                <br>
                We believe in the power of sports and the positive impact it can have on a child’s life. Our <br>
                mission is to make it easier for parents to be a part of this journey by providing them with the<br>
                tools they need to stay connected and informed. Join us in our mission to revolutionize <br>
                the way parents interact with sports schools. Together, we can make a difference.</p>
